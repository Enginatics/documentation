# Documentation Style Guide

This guide provides rules and best practices for all contributors to ensure the documentation is clear, consistent, and easy to maintain for both human and AI editors.

## Tone of Voice

*   **Audience:** Address a professional audience of Oracle EBS users and developers.
*   **Style:** Use a direct, clear, and concise tone.
*   **Voice:** Use the active voice whenever possible. For example, write "Blitz Report generates the file" instead of "The file is generated by Blitz Report."

## Formatting Rules

*   **Headings:** Use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) to structure content. The main document title should be a single `#` heading.
*   **Code Blocks:** All code blocks must specify the language for syntax highlighting.
    *   For SQL: ` ```sql `
    *   For Bash/Shell: ` ```bash `
*   **Emphasis:** Use bold (`**text**`) for UI elements like button names or menu options. Use italics (`*text*`) for emphasis on concepts or terms.
*   **Admonitions:** Use blockquotes with a note type for important information.
    *   `> **Note:** This is an important piece of information.`
    *   `> **Warning:** This action can have critical consequences.`

## Image Guidelines

*   **Storage:** All images must be stored in the root `/images` directory.
*   **Naming:** Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames (e.g., `blitz-report-main-screen.png`).
*   **Alt Text:** All images must have descriptive alternative text for accessibility. `![Descriptive alt text](path/to/image.png)`

## Linking Policy

*   **Internal Links:** Always use relative paths for links between documents within this repository. For example, from a file in `/developer_guide`, a link to the user guide would be `../user_guide/README.md`.
*   **External Links:** Use full, absolute URLs for links to external websites.

## Metadata Header (Frontmatter)

Every markdown file must begin with a YAML frontmatter block.

```yaml
---
title: "The Document Title"
last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
version: "Product version relevant to the doc"
owner: "Team or individual owner"
status: "Draft | In Review | Published"
ai_update_scope: "A concise, one-sentence directive explaining the file's purpose and boundaries for AI editors."
---
```
