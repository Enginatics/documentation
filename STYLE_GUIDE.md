# Documentation Style Guide

This guide provides rules and best practices for all contributors to ensure the documentation is clear, consistent, and easy to maintain for both human and AI editors.

## Tone of Voice

*   **Audience:** Address a professional audience of Oracle EBS users and developers.
*   **Style:** Use a direct, clear, and concise tone.
*   **Voice:** Use the active voice whenever possible. For example, write "Blitz Report generates the file" instead of "The file is generated by Blitz Report."

## Formatting Rules

*   **Headings:** Use Markdown headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) to structure content.
    *   `# Heading 1`: Reserved for main document titles, such as in `README.md` or `_coverpage.md`.
    *   `## Heading 2`: The top-level heading for all other content files (e.g., `## 1. Creating a Blitz Report`).
    *   `### Heading 3` and `#### Heading 4`: Used for subsequent sub-sections.

*   **Emphasis:**
    *   Use bold (`**text**`) for UI elements (e.g., **Run** button, **Setup** window) and for drawing strong attention to key phrases (e.g., "**Basic steps are:**").
    *   Use inline code (`` `text` ``) for technical terms, filenames, parameter names, and values (e.g., `part1_creating_report.md`, `n=n`, `:bind_variable`).
    *   Use italics (`*text*`) for general emphasis on a concept or for file paths.

*   **Code Blocks:** All code blocks must specify the language for syntax highlighting.
    *   For SQL: ` ```sql `
    *   For Bash/Shell: ` ```bash `

*   **Admonitions:** Use blockquotes with a note type for important information.
    *   `> **Note:** This is an important piece of information.`
    *   `> **Warning:** This action can have critical consequences.`

*   **Tables:** Use Markdown tables to present structured data, such as parameter descriptions or examples. Ensure headers are clear and content is aligned for readability.

## Image Guidelines

*   **Storage:** Images are stored in a subdirectory named `images` within the guide they belong to.
    *   User guide images go in `/user_guide/images/`.
    *   Developer guide images go in `/developer_guide/images/`.
*   **Naming:** Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames (e.g., `blitz-report-main-screen.png`).
*   **Alt Text:** All images must have descriptive alternative text for accessibility. `![Descriptive alt text](./images/image-name.png)`

## Linking Policy

*   **Internal Links:** Always use relative paths for links between documents within this repository. For example, from a file in `/developer_guide`, a link to the user guide would be `../user_guide/README.md`.
*   **External Links:** Use full, absolute URLs for links to external websites.

## Source Attribution

If the content of a file is derived from an external source, add an attribution link at the very end of the file in italics.
