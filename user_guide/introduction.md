# Blitz Report™ User Guide

## Introduction

Blitz Report is a reporting and data loading solution fully integrated with Oracle E-Business Suite. It provides two interface options: an Oracle Forms interface and an OAF (Oracle Application Framework) web interface. Users access Blitz Report directly from within the EBS navigation without requiring a separate login.

The solution enables your IT team to easily store and edit SQL scripts for reports, and to make them available to your business users. Blitz Report runs as a concurrent process and generates output files in XLSX or text delimited CSV format. Upon completion, reports automatically download and open in Excel with the first row frozen and autofilter enabled, ready for immediate use.

### Key Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Access reports directly from Oracle Forms screens via an Excel icon, with automatic parameter defaulting from your current screen context
- **Flexible Templates**: Create custom column layouts, sheet breaks, pivot tables, and Excel dashboards with charts and slicers
- **Data Loading**: Upload data into EBS with color-coded Excel files, LOV validation, and bulk server-side processing that handles large datasets efficiently
- **High Performance**: Export 100,000+ rows in seconds with automatic overflow to multiple Excel sheets for very large datasets
- **Financial Statement Generator**: Create custom financial statements with drill-down to subledger transaction details

With Blitz Report, we created the most efficient and easy to use operational reporting solution for Oracle EBS. Optimized for skilled IT professionals to better organize and maintain their reporting queries, and for business users to quickly access EBS data in a format they love without having to learn new skills.
