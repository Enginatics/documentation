# Blitz Report™ User Guide

## Introduction

Blitz Report is an Oracle Forms based software, fully integrated with Oracle E-Business Suite. It enables your IT team to easily store and edit SQL scripts for reports, and to make them available to your business users. Blitz Report runs as a concurrent process and generates output files in XLSX or text delimited CSV format. Upon completion, reports automatically download and open in Excel.

### User Interface Options

Blitz Report provides two interface options to accommodate different user preferences:

- **Oracle Forms Interface:** The primary interface, offering quick navigation and responsive performance. Most users prefer this interface for its speed and familiar Oracle EBS experience.
- **OAF (Oracle Application Framework) HTML Interface:** An alternative HTML-based interface for users who are not familiar with Oracle professional forms. This interface provides the same functionality with a web-based UI.

### Performance

Blitz Report generates Excel output files directly in the database using optimized PL/SQL code, without intermediate XML conversion steps. This approach delivers exceptional performance, allowing reports to open almost immediately and handling exports of millions of records efficiently.

With Blitz Report, we created the most efficient and easy to use operational reporting solution for Oracle EBS. Optimized for skilled IT professionals to better organize and maintain their reporting queries, and for business users to quickly access EBS data in a format they love without having to learn new skills.

We hope that you will enjoy working with Blitz Report as much as we do, and we welcome your feedback to [support@enginatics.com](mailto:support@enginatics.com).
