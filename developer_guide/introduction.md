# Blitz Report Developer Guide

## Introduction

Blitz Report is a reporting and data loading solution fully integrated with Oracle E-Business Suite. It provides both Oracle Forms and OAF (Oracle Application Framework) web interfaces. The solution enables your IT team to easily store and edit SQL scripts for reports, and to make them available to your business users. Blitz Report runs as a concurrent process and generates output files in XLSX or text delimited CSV format. Upon completion, reports automatically download and open in Excel.

### For Developers and IT Teams

Creating new reports is fast and straightforward: simply enter an SQL query directly in the report setup screen and immediately generate Excel output. This allows rapid development and prototyping without complex configuration.

### For DBAs and System Administrators

Blitz Report includes a library of technical reports useful for database performance tuning and system administration:

- **AWR Performance Summary**: Identifies the top SQL queries consuming the most CPU and I/O resources. By tuning the top 10 problematic queries, you can often reduce server load by 40% or more, enabling cost savings on cloud infrastructure through reduced CPU core requirements and database licensing.
- **System Monitoring Reports**: Various reports for tracking concurrent requests, user activity, and system health

### Version Compatibility

Blitz Report supports a wide range of Oracle EBS versions:
- Oracle E-Business Suite 11i through R12.2
- Oracle Database 11g onwards

With Blitz Report, we created the most efficient and easy to use operational reporting solution for Oracle EBS. Optimized for skilled IT professionals to better organize and maintain their reporting queries, and for business users to quickly access EBS data in a format they love without having to learn new skills.
