# 2. Prerequisites

## 2.1 Install Blitz Report in Oracle E-Business Suite

The Supply Chain Hub is built using Blitz Report functionality. Blitz Report must already be installed into the Oracle EBS instance before it is possible to install the Supply Chain Hub.

> **Note:** If you are running decentralized ASCP and wish to use the Action Release/Reschedule/Cancel recommendations functionality from the Supply Chain Hub running in the EBS Instance; then you must also install Blitz Report on the decentralized ASCP instance.

For Blitz Report installation instructions, please refer to the [Blitz Report Installation Guide](../installation_guide/README.md).
